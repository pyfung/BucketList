# Question

This is Assignment 1 of the C++ module CO3105/4105/7105 in 2021/22.

The question itself is in the cw1.html file. One day I might update it to a .md file here.

The source code here are the starting files. Solutions are not posted here (yet), so is the test suite.

# Context

Obviously, this is actually a hashtable. More precisely, it uses separate chaining and the table itself stores only the pointers (not the data). Since each slot in a hashtable is often referred to as a bucket, and each bucket is a linked list, I made up the name "BucketList". It has the curious side effect that some of our cheaters googled and submitted some bucket sort implementations.

# Cheating attempts

This assignment (and some slight variations made for reassessment purposes) elicited some interesting cheating submissions:

- This one is a work of art. In a resubmission attempt, two students decided to put my given starting .h file to some autorephrasing website... something normally only done to reports to evade Turnitin, but what do I know. The keyword "class" now becomes "elegance" or "beauty" (think "classy"). Their code are in the "rephraser" folder.

- One of the two students above (fa893, not their real id), in the original (first-attempt) submission, copied everything in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bucket-sort-2/, because from "bucket" google must have told them "bucket sort".

- Someone decided to copy this entire file: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/src/bucket/BucketList.h, simply because it has the same name. (It does some completely different things.)
