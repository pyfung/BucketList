# Question

This is Assignment 1 of the C++ module CO3105/4105/7105 in 2021/22.

The question itself is in the cw1.html file.

# Context

Obviously, this is actually a hashtable. More precisely, it uses separate chaining and the table itself stores only the pointers (not the data). Since each slot in a hashtable is often referred to as a bucket, and each bucket is a linked list, I made up the name "BucketList". It has the curious side effect that some of our cheaters googled and submitted some bucket sort implementations.
