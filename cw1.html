<h2>The Problem</h2>

You will implement a data structure for storing a collection of 
strings that supports efficient insertion, removal and search. We call the 
data structure "BucketList" here.
(Nope, that's not its real name, I made it up.)

<h3>Overview of the data structure</h3>

<p>
From an object-oriented point of view, I should not prescribe how you should 
implement the internal workings of the data structure as long as your
implementation complies with the specified external interface;
nevertheless, this is an assignment, so I am going to prescribe it.
</p>
<p>
The primary part of the data structure is an array of pointers. Each entry 
in the array, known as a <i>bucket</i>, is a pointer to the head of a 
linked list. 
Each string to be stored will be allocated (in a way to be described
later) to a bucket. If multiple strings are allocated to the same bucket,
each of them are stored in a different node in the linked list of that bucket.
</p>
<p>
To faciliate the storage of strings into these linked lists, a
<code>Node</code> class is defined as follows:
<pre>
class Node {
  string s_; // string stored at this node
  Node* next_; // pointer to next Node in the list
  ...
};
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The data structure is encapsulated in the <code>BucketList</code> class,
defined as follows:
<pre>
class BucketList {
  Node** buckets_; // pointer to an array of Node*
  ...
};
</pre>
The access point of this data structure is the <code>buckets_</code>
variable, which is an array of <code>Node*</code>. (As you will see below, 
this array will be dynamically resized, so instead of declaring it as 
<code>Node*[]</code>, it is declared as <code>Node**</code>.)
The size of this array is called the <i>capacity</i> of the 
BucketList (which is not the same thing as the number of strings stored).
The BucketList class is made a "friend" of the Node class. We will explain
what this means later, but all you need to know now is that BucketList
can access Node as if everything there is public.
</p>
<p>
Here is a picture showing (conceptually) how seven strings C++, F#, abc,
apple, banana, blue, c might be stored in a BucketList with capacity 10:
</p>
<img src="buckets.jpg">
<p>
Note that the strings themselves are never stored in the
<code>buckets_</code> array itself. 
Even if only one string is in a bucket, that bucket does not contain the
string, but rather a pointer to a Node that stores the string.
</p>

<h3>Mash functions</h3>

<p>
The way a string is allocated to a bucket is given by a <i>mash function</i>
(also a made-up name). This function takes any string and returns an integer. 
There are many ways that such a 
function can be defined, but for this assignment, we will use the 
following. Consider a string
s = s<sub>1</sub> s<sub>2</sub> s<sub>3</sub> ... s<sub>n</sub>
with n characters.
Let c<sub>i</sub> be the ASCII value corresponding to the character 
s<sub>i</sub> (For example,
A = 65, z = 122). Then the integer returned is given by the formula
c<sub>1</sub> + 2*c<sub>2</sub> + 4*c<sub>3</sub> + ... + 
2<sup>n-2</sup>*c<sub>n-1</sub> + 2<sup>n-1</sup>*c<sub>n</sub>.
To work out which bucket the string should go to,
this integer is further "restrained" to be between 0 and cap - 1,
where cap is the current capacity (number of buckets).
This is done by taking its
remainder when divided by cap (i.e. the C++ % operator).
</p>
<p>
For example, for the string "Hello", the mash value is
72 + 2*101 + 4*108 + 8*108 + 16*111 = 3346, and if there are currently
10 buckets, it should go to <code>buckets_[6]</code> since
3346 % 10 = 6.
</p>
<p>
We define an empty string to have a mash value of 0.
</p>

<h3>Supported operations</h3>

You should implement the <code>Node</code> and <code>BucketList</code>
classes so that BucketList supports the following functions:

<ul>
<li>
Default constructor, that constructs a BucketList with an
initial capacity (number of buckets) given by the constant
INITIAL_CAP, and initialises each bucket to contain a null pointer.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Destructor, that releases all memory used.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Copy constructor and copy assignment functions, that perform a deep
copy of another existing BucketList. 
They should really be exact copies, i.e., not just the set of strings are
identical but other states of the container, such as its capacity, should
be the same. The copy assignment operator should release all memory
of the existing BucketList that is being overwritten.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>bool contains(const string& s)</code>: return true if the string s is in the 
data structure, false otherwise.
<b>This is (almost) done for you as an example; however,</b> you will need to
modify the part with INITIAL_CAP, otherwise it
would not work correctly once the data structure is resized (more on
this later).
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void insert(const string& s)</code>: add the string s to the data structure. 
Before insertion, it should check whether resizing should happen first;
this is described separately below. Then, the string
should be added to the linked list of the bucket given by the mash value
of the string. If the bucket is currently empty (has no other string), it
should be added as the only node in a new linked list.
If there are other strings already in the same bucket, it should be inserted
into the linked list in increasing alphabetical order (i.e. the order
used by C++ string comparisons) of the strings.
If the string is already in the BucketList, do not make any changes.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void remove(const string& s)</code>: remove the string s from the data
structure. You should remove the Node object containing that string from
the relevant linked list. The memory must be properly released.
If s is not in the BucketList, do not make any changes.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>string tostring()</code>: returns a string that would give a "visual"
representation of the contents of the BucketList. More precisely, there 
should be one row per bucket. Each row begins with a number which is the
index to the <code>buckets_</code> array (i.e. the mash value of the 
strings in that bucket),
followed by each string in the linked list of that bucket, in 
alphabetical order.
Every string (and the leading number) are separated by one space character.
For example, the BucketList above will
be printed like this:
<pre>
0 F# blue
1
2 banana
3
4
5 C++
6
7
8
9 abc apple c
</pre>
The whole printout is stored in one string (which will contain 
multiple lines, separated by the '\n' character) and returned to the caller;
the function itself does not print anything to the screen.
Please take care not to include any extra invisible whitespaces 
(which will make you fail the test cases).
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int h(const string& s)</code>: this is the mash function. It should return
the value  <i>before</i> the % operator is applied to it.
You can assume the string is "not too long" so the calculation will not
result in numbers too large to fit inside a C++ int.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int getSize()</code>: return the number of strings currently stored
in the data structure.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int getCap()</code>: return the current capacity of the data structure,
i.e. the number of buckets in the array.
</li>
</ul>

<b>This function is meant to be very difficult.</b>

<p>
In all the above functions, you can assume the input string s
only contains "normal", printable ASCII characters.
</p>

<h3>Resizing</h3>

<p>
The performance of a BucketList depends on whether many strings are in
the same bucket (i.e. whether some linked lists are very long). Ideally,
each bucket should not have more than one string, so none of insertion,
removal or search require traversing any linked list: all it needs to do
is to calculate the mash value of the string and jump to that bucket.
However, as more and more strings are inserted, there will be "collisions"
(where multiple strings go to the same bucket), and if some buckets have 
many nodes (i.e. the linked list in that bucket is very long), all the 
operations will become inefficient.
</p>
<p>The <i>load factor</i> is the ratio between the number of strings 
currently stored and the capacity (number of buckets).
The data structure should only allow a maximum load factor,
defined in the MAX_LOAD_FACTOR constant.
If an insertion would result in the maximum load factor being exceeded, the 
BucketList should double its capacity first, before performing the insertion.
By doubling, we mean you should create a new array with twice the capacity,
and insert each existing string into the correct bucket in the new array.
Note that the mash values will change and strings that are in the same
bucket (same linked list) before resizing may be distributed to different
buckets afterwards. The old array need to be cleaned up properly (memory released).
</p>
<p>
For illustration, suppose we use the default INITIAL_CAP and MAX_LOAD_FACTOR
values in the code, and then seven strings are inserted and stored as 
depicted above. Then when another string "red" is inserted, the
BucketList should look like this, as produced by the 
<code>toString()</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
0 F#
1
2
3
4
5 C++
6
7
8
9 abc apple
10 blue
11
12 banana
13
14
15
16 red
17
18
19 c
</pre>
<!--
<p>
Note that this may not be the only correct representation: previous insertions/
removals may have changed the capacity of the data structure and so
the table may have more buckets and strings allocated differently.
</p>
-->
<p>
Note that resizing only happens before insertion. If the data structure
becomes "too empty" due to many removals, "shrinking" will not take place.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Please refer to the BucketList.h and BucketList.cpp files
for the exact specification of what each function should do.
</p>
-->

<h3>What you can and cannot do</h3>

<p>
You must not change the existing public interface of the classes, and
you must not change the existing private data members of the classes.
You are allowed to add public or private member functions, or private
data members, should you want to.
</p>
<p>
You must not use containers from the Standard Template Library (STL),
nor smart pointers. (Both of these will be covered later in the module.)
</p>

<h2>Files Provided</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="BucketList.h">BucketList.h</a></li>
<li><a href="BucketList.cpp">BucketList.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
These are the only two files you need to modify/submit. All code written
by you should be in there.
<ul>
<li><a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
This is just an example that illustrates how the 
functions can be called.
<ul>
<li><a href="BucketListTester.h">BucketListTester.h</a></li>
<li><a href="BucketListTester.cpp">BucketListTester.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="BucketListTesterMain.cpp">BucketListTesterMain.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
They are used for the execution testing part (see the next section).
<ul>
<li><a href="makefile">makefile</a></li>
</ul>
This is a makefile that will compile the main executable and the test
suite executable.

<h2>Marking Criteria and Test Suite</h2>

<p>
See <a href="ms.html">this separate page</a> for the marking criteria.
</p>
<p>
To use the test suite (which is used in the execution testing part of the 
marking), simply type "make" in a linux terminal (with all 
the above files in the same folder). It will (assuming you did not break
BucketList.h or BucketList.cpp) produce a BucketListTesterMain executable file. Run the 
program by typing
<pre>
./BucketListTesterMain a
</pre>
or
<pre>
./BucketListTesterMain a b c d
</pre>
which runs a single test case or multiple test cases respectively. 
We will also demonstrate its use in class. 
</p>
<p>
The given BucketList.h and BucketList.cpp files (without your contributions)
are already compilable with the test suite. 
It might even pass a few test cases. So, whatever you do, please don't 
break them...
</p>
<p>
The test suite may not cover all corner cases, so passing all test
cases does not guarantee your program is 100% correct.
Also, unfortunately we cannot isolate the testing of the various functions.
For example to pass those test cases meant for <code>toString()</code> you 
need to also implement <code>insert()</code> at least partially correctly.
</p>
